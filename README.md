## 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Key Insights

 -Displays overall performance with Total Sales (4.74M), Total Transactions (18K), and Total Refunds (4.78M).
 
 -Shows sales distribution by payment method, where credit and digital payments contribute the largest share.
 
 -Compares sales vs refunds by transaction type, helping identify refund-heavy activities.
 
 -Visualizes sales and refund trends over time, making it easy to spot fluctuations and patterns.
 
 -Highlights monthly sales and transaction volume to understand seasonal behavior.
 
 -Ranks top-selling products, with smartphones and tablets generating the highest revenue.
 
 -Interactive filters (year, transaction type, payment method, product) allow flexible analysis.


## Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates how raw financial transaction data can be cleaned and transformed into reliable information for real-world decision-making. It focuses on handling inconsistent and incomplete data, exploring transaction patterns, and presenting insights in a clear visual form.

Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and a Power BI dashboard, the project supports effective financial monitoring, reporting, and data-driven business decisions.
